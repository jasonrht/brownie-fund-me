FreeCodeCamp Python-Solidity tutorial -- Brownie Fund me

My first Solidity project created within the Brownie Python framework. It follows the FreeCodeCamp Python-Solidity tutorial, with a small personal twist to it. The FundMe page is connected to the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet. A user can connect his MetaMask to the website and send Rinkeby test ether to a smart contract to make a donation.
